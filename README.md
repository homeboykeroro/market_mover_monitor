FUNCTION:

- This program is to facilitate day trading, finding some stocks in top gainer list to trade intra-day. Once program starts it keep scanning top gainers in pre-market or normal trading hours, depending on program start time. 1 minute candle chart is retrieved for pattern analysis. i.e stocks that are gapping up quickly and high volume ramp up.


DISCLAIMER:

- Don't try to blindly follow anyone's strategies. This program is not universal. I'm still learning how to trade and programming. This repository is to share my trading and programming knowledge only.
